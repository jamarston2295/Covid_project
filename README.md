We have all seen how coronavirus has impacted the world, crippling vital infrastructure and causing mass deaths from the smallest islands to the most powerful countries in the world. All over the news there have been debates about how this virus should be dealt with, why certain people are more at risk than others and why some countries seem to be fairing better than others. The data is very fresh and we are still in the midst of this pandemic, and as such we are seeing experts disagreeing with each other, people disagreeing about the data and people misrepresenting data. As an example, it has been shown that various racial groups, including Black and Asian, seem to have suffered disproportionately during this virus, at least in the UK and US. This was initially attributed to some kind of systemic racism, however, a number of very important have to be considered when answering the question of why we see this. The first important note is that Black and Asian people have a higher incidence of diabetes, which appears to be one of the stronger indicators of death from coronavirus. There are also cultural factors, such as some Asian communities being more likely to have generations living together, meaning older people aren't being shielded as well as those who don't live with their children or grandchildren. I think this kind of breakdown and analysis is vitally important to help understand why we see the data we do, and if there are any variables which are strong indicators of higher coronavirus deaths per country and can therefore be targeted to potentially save lives. In this project I have decided to perform an extensive analysis of many factors to help understand various relationships between the variables and the number of deaths in a country.
